# AGENTS.md — BlkSpace Operating Instructions

## Project Overview
BlkSpace (weixblack.net) — amalgamation social platform.
Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Solana + Anchor.
Cross-platform: macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android (future).

## Dev Environment
- Codespaces-first: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- If local: Node 22+, pnpm, Rust stable, Tauri CLI
- CI: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`)
- No Docker locally (disk constraint). Use CI for builds.

## Key Files
- `README.md` — repo entry point (students vs devs vs docs map)
- `docs/README.md` — documentation map
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Yard vs Full, Tier C, Phase 5, next milestones
- `docs/YARD_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` — Device B + v0.1.0-yard release gate
- `DEVOPS.md` — full pipeline docs
- `SOUL.md` — project persona
- `FLESHTHEORY.md` — phased approach, Tier 0 constraint, economic model
- `TIER0_USER.md` — student install guide (download only; no builds)
- `docs/TOP_DOWN_APPROACH.md` — Nostr/Iroh/Solana to 5-layer network stack
- `docs/security-considerations.md` — Nostr attack mitigations
- `docs/architecture-blueprint.md` — Federated College-Town Relay Mesh
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — lint → typecheck → test → build (includes windows-latest)
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-triggered releases (macOS + Linux + Windows)
- `Code-Companion/package.json` — root workspace config
- `Code-Companion/artifacts/blkspace/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — Rust deps

```

## Development Rules
1. Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` before committing
2. Keep `node_modules` and Rust `target/` off disk — use pnpm store in /tmp
3. Push to GitHub to trigger CI — don't build Tauri locally unless necessary
4. Write tests for new features (Vitest for frontend, Rust tests for Tauri)
5. Keep dependencies minimal — every byte counts on low-end machines
6. All blockchain code goes through Anchor framework

## Agent Safety & Destructive Operation Guardrails
> Bleeding-edge projects often contain untracked state the user may not think to name explicitly. Agents must protect that state.

1. **Confirm before any destructive operation** — including but not limited to:
   - `rm -rf`, `rm` of files outside obvious caches (`node_modules`, `target`, `dist`)
   - `git reset`, `git revert`, `git clean`, force-pushes
   - dropping tables, deleting wallets/keys, deleting `test-ledger/`, `devnet/`, `.local/`, `attached_assets/`
2. **Explain the risk and recovery path** before asking for confirmation.
3. **Assume untracked files in these paths are user state**, not disposable cache:
   - `Code-Companion/artifacts/solana/devnet/`
   - `Code-Companion/artifacts/solana/test-ledger/`
   - `Code-Companion/attached_assets/`
   - `Code-Companion/.local/`
   - Any `.env`, keypair, manifest, backup, or ledger file
4. **When the user says "clean up"**, clarify scope explicitly. Do not infer permission to delete files.
5. **Prefer preservation over cleanup** — if unsure, leave it, add it to `.gitignore`, and ask.
6. **Document any deletion** in the commit message with rationale and recovery instructions.
7. **No automated deletion of files >10 MB or outside build artifacts** without explicit, item-by-item user approval.

## Windows / Low-End Machine Workflow
- **Frontend-only dev**: `pnpm dev` (from `Code-Companion/`) starts Vite web preview. No Rust needed. Uses ~200MB.
- **CI builds the desktop app**: Push to GitHub; `ci.yml` builds Tauri for `windows-latest`. Download artifacts.
- **Tagged releases**: Push a `v*` tag; `release.yml` produces `.msi` installer for Windows.
- **Local Rust build** (only if modifying Rust code): `cd artifacts/blkspace && pnpm tauri build`
- **Low-RAM build**: `$env:CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1` before building (reduces parallelism)

## Rust Build Optimization
- `Cargo.toml` has `iroh-blobs` (40+ crates) in default features. For Phase 0-only builds:
  - Remove `default = ["iroh"]` from `[features]` to drop ~300 crates from compilation
  - CI has separate `build-tauri-iroh` job for Iroh builds

## Workspace
- Git root: `/workspaces/blkspace` (Codespaces) or `~/Desktop/BlkSpoof` (local)
- Remote: `git@github.com:er1cbrown/BlkSpace.git`
- All CI commands run inside `./Code-Companion/` (pnpm workspace root)
- Tauri build runs in `./Code-Companion/artifacts/blkspace`
